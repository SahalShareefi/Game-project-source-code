Please install Unity engine first to be able to run the source code.

The front-end scripts done by me are:
 GroundNode.cs, General_UI.cs, city_Build_Manager_Editor.cs, Building_Logic.cs, CollectBuildingParts.cs, Detector_And_Progress.cs, CameraController.cs, and CameraFollow.cs.

Looking for your feedback & comments, thank you :)
